# DATABASE

The database in this project was MSSQL Localdb. To build the database, go to Visual Studio 2019 and select "View > SQL Server Object Explorer." A new panel will appear on the left. Follow the path "SQL Server > (localdb)MSSQLLocalDB" from this panel, then right-click on the "Databases" folder in the opened folders below, pick "Add New Database," and build your database. Cars is the name of my database.

# LAYERED ARCHITECTURE:

+ I used layered architecture while preparing the backend of our project. The names of these layers are Business, Core, DataAccess, Entity and WebApi. For each layer, I first created 2 folders called Abstract and Concrete. I wrote the interface codes in the Abstract folder and the codes I used these interfaces in the Concrete folder.

+ **Entities Layer:** It's here that the object classes that will be used throughout the application are specified. Each class in this layer corresponds to a database table, and it also contains DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes that link data from multiple tables

+ **Data Access Layer:** It's the layer that handles database connections and operations. The necessary database connection setting is completed here. This layer also encodes activities like data extraction, addition, deletion, and updating.

+ **Business Layer:** It is the layer where business rules are defined and controlled. When a command comes to the program, what actions it should perform and which set of rules it should pass through are defined here. Cross-Cutting Concerns are triggered in this layer.

+ **Core Layer:** It is the part where structures, cross-cutting concerns, aspects, extensions and tools to be used in common in all layers are coded.

+ **Service Layer (Web API):** It is the part where the services that enable the Front-End part and other platforms to communicate with the program and perform operations are written.
